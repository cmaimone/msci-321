Exercises to practice working with data frames.  There are multiple ways you might do many of these exercises.  Just because your code doesn't match the answer key exactly doesn't mean it's wrong.  Please ask the instructors if you have questions.

# Following Week 3 Material

## Exercise 

Load `data/diabetes.csv`.  Basic information on the dataset is available here: https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/diabetes


```{r}
diabetes <- read_csv("data/diabetes.csv")
```


## Exercise 

What are the names of the variables in the data?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

How many observations are in the data?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

What is the average age of study participants?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

What is the standard deviation of age?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

Plot a histogram of the age variable.  Plot a histogram of A1C (glyhb).  The function for a histogram is hist().

```{r}


```



## Exercise 

What is the average systolic blood pressure (1st reading)?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

Make a frequency table of participant gender (how many participants are male? how many female?)

```{r}


```


## Challenge Exercise

Make a bar plot of gender.  To do this, 

1. Find the function for making a bar plot (use your research skills).  Use the built-in R function, not ggplot2.
2. Supply the output of the frequency table for gender to the function (the bar plot function wants the count of each category, not the raw vector)

```{r}


```



## Exercise 

Save a subset of the diabetes data in a new variable without the columns bp.2s, bpp.2d, or time.ppn in it

```{r}


```



## Exercise 

Make a new variable in the data frame called `male` that is TRUE if the participant is male and FALSE otherwise.  

```{r}


```



## Exercise 

Make a new variable in the data frame called `bmi` that is calculated as: 703 * weight รท (height ^ 2)

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

What is the tallest height in the data?  What about the shortest?

```{r}


```




# Following Week 4 Material

Remember: Reload the dataset (first exercise above) if you don't have it in your environment anymore.


## Exercise 

How many participants have A1C (glyhb) levels above 7?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

What proportion of participants have A1C levels above 7?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

What is the average height for each gender?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

How many participants have each frame size?

```{r}


```


## Exercise

What is the proportion of participants with each frame size?

```{r}


```


## Exercise

What is the average height of people with each frame size?  Weight?

```{r}


```


## Exercise

What is the average height of people with each frame size by gender?  Weight?

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

What is the average A1C (glyhb) of participants with a weight > 250?

```{r}


```


## Challenge Exercise

What proportion of the participants over age 60 have an A1C > 7?

Note: this is only a "challenge" question because it requires more steps/is a bit trickier than the other questions.  But you know everything you need to do this.

```{r}


```



## Exercise

What is the average cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, systolic blood pressure (use just 1st reading), and diastolic blood pressure (use just first reading) by location? 

Challenge: compute this with `across()` instead of typing out the expression for each variable individually.


```{r}


```


## Challenge Exercise

What is the ratio variable?  Figure it out by exploring the data and making educated guesses.

```{r}


```


## Exercise

How many participants have the maximum height value in the data?

```{r}


```



## Challenge Exercise

What is the weight of the shortest participant?

Hint: you might want to look up the which.min function (although there are other ways to do it).  Or the slice_min function.

```{r}


```

Double challenge: looking at the documentation for which.max, why would it be a problem to use it to find the weight of the tallest participant?


## Challenge Exercise

How many participants have a cholesterol level more than two standard deviations above the mean?

Hint: it's not 0

```{r}


```


## Exercise 

How many participants have a blood pressure (first reading) with systolic > 120 **and** diastolic > 80?

How many participants have a blood pressure (first reading) with systolic > 120 **or** diastolic > 80?

```{r}


```


## Challenge Exercise

Who is the youngest patient with A1C (glyhb) > 7?

```{r}


```
